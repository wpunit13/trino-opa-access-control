# Version-hygiene merge guard (docs/RELEASING.md Rule 1).
#
# Runs as a PR-triggered CI step. Two checks, both fail with a message citing
# Rule 1 ("versions change only in the release workflow, stamped from the tag"):
#
#   a) STATE: the resolved project version on the PR head ends in -SNAPSHOT.
#      main is a permanent dev marker; nothing in a PR should change it.
#
#   b) DIFF: no <version> line in any pom.xml that already exists at the
#      merge-base, added or removed relative to it. Newly ADDED pom files (new
#      modules) are exempt — they legitimately declare their own version at
#      birth. Lines whose entire version content is a single ${...} property
#      reference (e.g. <version>${project.version}</version> in
#      dependencyManagement) are exempt too: they pin no literal version, so
#      they are not a hand edit under Rule 1.
#
# Escape hatch: commits whose subject contains [version-bump] are exempt from
# the diff check (legitimate dependency upgrades, or the one-time change of the
# dev marker itself).
